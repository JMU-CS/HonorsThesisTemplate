1. General Notes

  (a) All LaTeX commands (e.g., \abstractpage) listed in this template must be
        included as written (exception: \abstractmultiplepage may be commented out
        if the abstract occupies only the first page)

  (b) For appendix chapters, you have to use the command appchapter{} instead
        of chapter{} due to a page-numbering difference.

2. Abstract

    Currently, the template file (thesis.tex) includes on line 151 the
    optional command "\abstractmultiplepage" to create a second page for the abstract.
    If you have an abstract that extends to more than 1 page, you will need to carefully
    place this LaTeX command where you want the page break and then carefully check the 
    page numbering scheme from the beginning of the document until the beginning of 
    Chapter 1.

3. Figures and Tables

  (a) If you need additional space are figures or tables, you can optionally
      add the \figSpace (or \tableSpace) after the caption for figures.  For example:

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figGeorgeMason}\\
            \caption{An appropriate historical figure}

            % This adds separation space between this figure and either another
            %   figure, or between the figure and the text.
            \figSpace
        \end{figure}

        or the command \tableSpace after the tabular environment for a table:

        \begin{table}
            \centering
            \caption{Another table}
            % Tabular environment goes AFTER the caption!
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
            \hline
            1 & 2 & 3 \\\hline
            4 & 5 & 6 \\\hline
            7 & 8 & 9 \\
            \hline
            \end{tabular}

            % This adds separation space between this table and either another
            %   table, or between the table and the text.
            \tableSpace
        \end{table}

        Currently, \figSpace and \tableSpace are set in both set to a 0.3"
        vertical skip in thesis.sty but could be changed in principle.

  (b) Figures (or tables) that appear on a page without any narrative text would
        tend to be centered on the page by LaTeX.  However, in some cases,
        you might require that such figures be forced to the top of their page.  
        Review the document carefully for these cases, and if you find a situation where
        you need the figure/table to be at the top of the page, you can add the 
        [!t] directive.  Here is an example of doing that:

        \begin{figure}[!t]

            ... (FIGURE CODE) ...

        \end{figure}

        This should force the picture to the top of the page.  (I say "should" since
        I have found cases in which this does not work properly; this method should
        still represent the first attempt at fixing the problem, however.)
